# E-Commerce-Analytics-Sales-Customers-Growth-Trends

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract meaningful business insights using **Python** and **SQL**. The analysis covers customer behavior, sales performance, revenue trends, and customer retention to support data-driven decision-making. The objective is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills and the ability to translate raw data into actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

The dataset represents e-commerce operations in Brazil and includes approximately **100,000 orders** recorded between **2016 and 2018**. It provides detailed information related to orders, customers, sellers, products, payments, and geographic locations.

### Data Files

The dataset consists of the following CSV files:

* `customers.csv`
* `sellers.csv`
* `orders.csv`
* `order_items.csv`
* `products.csv`
* `payments.csv`
* `geolocation.csv`

## Tools and Technologies

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* SQL
* Jupyter Notebook
*  MySQL (for query execution)

## Data Preparation

* Removed duplicate and inconsistent records
* Handled missing values where applicable
* Converted date columns to proper datetime format
* Joined multiple tables to create an analytical dataset
* Performed data validation checks to ensure accuracy

## Key Analysis Questions

### Basic Analysis

* Order volume distribution
* Product and customer overview
* Revenue summary statistics

### Intermediate Analysis

1. Number of orders placed per month in 2018
2. Average number of products per order grouped by customer city
3. Percentage contribution of each product category to total revenue
4. Correlation between product price and purchase frequency
5. Total revenue generated by each seller and revenue-based ranking

### Advanced Analysis

1. Moving average of order values for each customer over time
2. Cumulative sales per month for each year
3. Year-over-year growth rate of total sales
4. Customer retention rate within six months of first purchase
5. Top three customers by total spending for each year

## Visualizations

Key insights are supported using visualizations such as:

* Monthly order trends
* Revenue contribution by product category
* Year-over-year sales growth
* Customer retention patterns

These visualizations help simplify complex data patterns and highlight actionable trends.

## Key Insights

* Identified seasonal trends in order volume and revenue
* Highlighted high-performing product categories and sellers
* Measured customer retention and repeat purchase behavior
* Analyzed long-term business growth through cumulative and YoY metrics
* Recognized high-value customers contributing significantly to revenue

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL and Python for end-to-end data analysis. It highlights the ability to work with real-world datasets, perform complex analytical queries, and communicate insights through visualizations. The analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of e-commerce business performance and customer behavior.
